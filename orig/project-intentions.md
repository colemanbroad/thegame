# A bad outcome

We don't have any fun.
We don't produce anything that makes our lives easier for this EUROs on June 14th.
The site must be ready a few days before the start of the tournament!

I learn a bunch of Digital Ocean details just in time for Jack to convince me to swtich to Lambdas.
I never pick up go again or build another website.
